// ===============================================

// PHP - What are Classes and Objects?

// example of class =  fruits  && example of object = apple,banana etc

// class = is a template for objects  
// template (a thing that is used as a model for producing other similar examples)

// object = instance of a class
// instance(an example)

// note:- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.
